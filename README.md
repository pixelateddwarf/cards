This is a card program in Ruby


Goals for the program:

1 - define a deck class 

2 - in the deck class build an initializer 

3 - in the initializer, build up every single card in the deck of cards and store it in an @ varable. This will be an array. 

4 - define a method called shuffle, which will trigger the shuffle method in the @ variable that is defined 

5 - define a method called deal, which will take the top card and pull it off the deck
